## Frontend

- Clone this repo locally
- Now, change to the backend directory with your terminal or preferred console
```sh
cd backend
npm i
npm start
```
If you want to run tests run
```sh
npm test
```
The backend will run in the port 4000 

Now go for the frontend...

## Frontend

```sh
cd frontend
npm i
npm start
```

And that is it, the frontend will run in the port 3000
